# **Typography Update Instructions (No Code)**

## **1. Add New Fonts to the Project**

* Remove any existing fonts from the project (Google Fonts links, imports, or old font files).
* Add the following two Google Fonts to the project:

  * **Inter** → for body text and UI elements.
  * **Space Grotesk** → for headings, titles, hero text, and logo text.
* Ensure these two fonts are the only fonts applied globally.

---

## **2. Apply Global Typography Rules**

### **Body Text (Default Font)**

* Set **Inter** as the default font for:

  * Paragraphs
  * List items
  * Navigation links
  * Buttons
  * Form inputs
  * Footer text
  * Any general UI components
* Make sure the line spacing is comfortable and readable.

### **Headings and Titles**

* Use **Space Grotesk** for:

  * H1–H6 headings
  * Page titles
  * Hero section headings
  * Card titles
  * Section headings
  * Logo text (if text-based)
* Headings should appear bold and prominent.
* Adjust letter spacing slightly for a cleaner tech look.

---

## **3. Remove All Old Typography References**

Search the entire project for:

* Old font names (e.g., Poppins, Roboto, Nunito, Montserrat, etc.)
* Old font imports
* Old font-family declarations
  Remove or replace them so the site uses **only Inter and Space Grotesk**.

---

## **4. Update Component-Level Typography**

For components like:

* Hero section
* Program cards
* Feature blocks
* Navigation menu
* Footer sections
  Ensure that:
* Headings inside these components use **Space Grotesk**.
* Descriptions and small text use **Inter**.

---

## **5. Improve Visual Hierarchy**

Apply consistent styling patterns:

* Headings should be significantly larger than body text.
* Body text should be clean, readable, and medium weight.
* Button text should use Inter with slightly stronger weight.
* Navigation items may use uppercase with slightly increased spacing.

---

## **6. Ensure Responsive Typography**

* Verify that headings scale properly on mobile.
* Ensure text doesn’t overflow cards or sections.
* Adjust spacing so paragraphs remain readable on all screen sizes.

---

## **7. Design Goals to Follow**

* The overall look should feel **modern, clean, tech-inspired, and trustworthy**.
* Inter gives a professional, neutral base.
* Space Grotesk adds a modern and sophisticated touch for headings.
* The combination should improve clarity, visual hierarchy, and overall polish.

---

## **8. Final Consistency Check**

After applying changes, verify:

* All headings use Space Grotesk.
* All general text uses Inter.
* No previous fonts appear anywhere.
* Typography appears consistent across all pages.
* Mobile, tablet, and desktop views look balanced.
